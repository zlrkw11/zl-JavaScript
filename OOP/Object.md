# Object

example would be like a car. Cars share the same properties but the values differ from
car to car.

objects can contain more values compared to variables.

```
const car = { type: "Mitsubishi", model: "Lancer", color: "blue" };
```

Object Literal
A list of **name:value** pairs inside curly braces.

```
{type: "Mitsubishi", model: "Lancer", color: "blue"}
```

can use the **new** keyword to create a new object.

```
const person = new Object();
```
